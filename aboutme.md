title: About me
---

I studied economics and philosophy in college but graduated without the ability to apply my knowledge to real-world problems, like analyzing messy data. I could do math and write, but not code, and my interest in law (read: centuries of spaghetti code) waned the more I learned about it.

Since then, I've come to love data science and data engineering. I now have familiarity with the whole data pipeline: collecting, querying, storing, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, modeling, and communicating data to technical or non-technical people. Scraping, regular expressions, predictive modeling, and writing clean code are my biggest strengths, but I'm always learning something new.
